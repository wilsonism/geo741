## I. Course Description

This seminar provides an introduction to teaching with particular focus on pedagogical issues in geography. At the completion of this course, students will have a background sufficient to enable them to assume full responsibility for university and college-level courses.

## II. Course Goals and Objectives

By placing teaching practices directly under scrutiny, this course shall:
* Trace recent socio-technical developments in the university which impact the classroom;
* Explore a variety of teaching techniques and technologies; and
* Create and refine best practices in the classroom that enroll an articulated teaching philosophy.

## III. Student Learning Outcomes

By the completion of this practicum, students shall be able to articulate their own vision for teaching while demonstrating techniques that enable that vision, while situating this philosophy in the context of changes in higher education. More specifically, students will:
* Observe a lower-division and upper-division undergraduate classroom;
* Design lesson plans, visual materials, and delivery techniques that enhance learning;
* Situate the contemporary classroom within broader debates in higher education; and
* Compose a teaching philosophy; and
* Evaluate the teaching practices of others, constructively.

## IV. Format

This course will be composed primarily of discussions and in-class activities. Students will also be required to schedule, attend, evaluate, and report on one lower-division and one upper-division undergraduate class session during the term.

## V. Required Texts

There will be required texts for some seminar discussions. Students will be responsible for gaining access to these texts from UK Libraries. Consult the course calendar below for a reading schedule (subject to change). You are attending a research 1 university, taking classes with people who do original research. As such, you may have the opportunity to read journal articles and book chapters published by your professors. Professors are not paid royalties for these publications, but they are how information is disseminated for the academic community.

## VI. Assignments, Activities, and Grading

### Assessment overview.

Students will be assessed in this practicum, for a total of 100 points:
* Report 1 (20 points)
* Report 2 (20 points)
* Discussions and Exercises (30 points)
* Teaching Philosophy (30 points)

Final grades will be based on a standard scale, i.e., A=90-100%; B=80-89%; C=70-79%; D=60-69%; E=less than 60%. Grades for all assignments will be available via the University of Kentucky Canvas system (http://uk.instructure.com).

### Reports.

Two reports will be required: one based on evaluation of a lower-division undergraduate course and one based on evaluation of an upper-division undergraduate course. Courses must be in Geography. Students are required to schedule the observation with the primary instructor (cannot be a graduate student instructor). Reports must be no more than 2-pages double-spaced, addressing (1) techniques and technologies, (2) style and performance, (3) engagement and learning.

### Discussions and exercises.

Each scheduled meeting will be composed of discussions and exercises. The exact format will vary from week to week. Students are required to attend, to gain credit for these activities.

### Teaching philosophy.

A teaching philosophy is a document that outlines a vision of teaching and learning. After reviewing and evaluating examples of teaching philosophies, students will iteratively produce their own teaching philosophy. The teaching philosophy must be no more than 3-pages double-spaced.

## VII. Important Notices

### Prepare for this course.

Review the course syllabus carefully, paying special attention to due dates and assignment instructions. If you have questions about course expectations as overviewed by this syllabus, please contact me as soon as possible.

### Attend class.

There are many in-class activities that will require your attendance.

### Be in contact.

You are responsible for checking your UKY email account; Canvas is what will be used to send communications outside class. Email is the best way to contact the instructor. Please allow at least 24 hours for a response by email during weekdays. The instructor will not necessarily respond to emails over the weekends.

### Be a resource for others.

Students are strongly encouraged to exchange contact information with classmates, in order to facilitate the objectives of this studio.

### Get permission before recording.

Meetings of this course may be recorded. All video and audio recordings of lecturers and class meetings, provided by the instructors, are for educational use by students in this class only. They are available only through the Canvas shell for this course and are not to be copied, shared, or redistributed.

The University of Kentucky Student Code of Conduct defines Invasion of Privacy as using electronic or other devices to make a photographic, audio, or video record of any person without their prior knowledge or consent when such a recording is likely to cause injury or distress. As addressed in the Student Code of Conduct, students are expected to follow appropriate university policies and maintain the security of linkblue accounts used to access recorded class materials. Recordings may not be reproduced, shared with those not enrolled in the class, or uploaded to other online environments.

If the instructor or a University of Kentucky office plans any other uses for the recordings, beyond this class, students identifiable in the recordings will be notified to request consent prior to such use. In anticipation of such cases, students may be asked to complete an “authorization of use” form by a faculty member.

Video and audio recordings by students are not permitted during the class unless the student has received prior permission from the instructor. Any sharing, distribution, and or uploading of these recordings outside of the parameters of the class is prohibited. Students with specific recording accommodations approved by the Disability Resource Center should present their official documentation to the instructor.

All content for this course, including handouts, assignments, and lectures are the intellectual property of the instructors and cannot be reproduced or sold without prior permission from the instructors. A student may use the material for reasonable educational and professional purposes extending beyond this class, such as studying for a comprehensive or qualifying examination in a degree program, preparing for a professional or certification examination, or to assist in fulfilling responsibilities at a job or internship.

### Get help.

If you are having difficulty with any course material, please contact the instructor. There are also other resources which you might find useful:
* Pauer Center for Cartography & GIS in Miller Hall 5, https://geography.as.uky.edu/cartlab
* The University Writing Center, https://uky.mywconline.com
* Map Collections, Science Library in King Library 410C, http://libguides.uky.edu/maps
* Counseling Center, https://www.uky.edu/counselingcenter/student-services

### Meet deadlines.

Meeting deadlines is an important professional practice. Consult the course schedule, below, for the due dates of the course assignments. A 10-percent deduction will be applied to the final score of your assignment for submissions after the deadline on the same calendar day, with an additional 10-percent deduction for each additional calendar day the assignment is late. If the assignment is not delivered by the next class meeting, the assignment will not be accepted.

### Be honest.

This course, if successful, will expose you to a variety of concepts and techniques. You are expected to draw upon these various ideas, but you must be transparent and honest about your use of these ideas. Please get help if you are uncertain about this expectation! Per university policy, students shall not plagiarize, cheat, or falsify or misuse academic records. Students should familiarize themselves with policies regarding Academic Offenses (available at https://www.uky.edu/universitysenate/ao). **Please note:** Any assignment you turn in may be submitted to an electronic database to check for plagiarism.

### Be respectful.

Students should at all times be respectful of fellow students, the professor or teaching assistant(s), and the University of Kentucky. Some basic reminders:
* Silence all mobile devices.
* Show up on time. Late arrivals (and unnecessary) early departures are rude and disruptive.
* Put away your reading material (other than materials necessary for the lecture/course).
* Talking and whispering during class is disrespectful to the professor and fellow students and makes it more difficult for those who want to learn to do so.
* Be attentive to and respectful of other students’ contributions to class discussions. Discussion must not include attacks of a personal nature, including denigrating another on the basis of skin color, sex, religion, sexual orientation, age, national/regional origin or other such irrelevant factors.

### Renew your commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

The University of Kentucky is committed to our core values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and human dignity, and a sense of community (Governing Regulations XIV, available at [https://www.uky.edu/regs/gr14](https://www.uky.edu/regs/gr14)). We acknowledge and respect the seen and unseen diverse identities and experiences of all members of the university community ([https://www.uky.edu/regs/gr14](https://www.uky.edu/regs/gr14)). These identities include but are not limited to those based on race, ethnicity, gender identity and expressions, ideas and perspectives, religious and cultural beliefs, sexual orientation, national origin, age, ability, and socioeconomic status. We are committed to equity and justice and providing a learning and engaging community in which every member is engaged, heard, and valued.

We strive to rectify and change behavior that is inconsistent with our principles and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. If students encounter such behavior in a course, they are encouraged to speak with the instructor of record and/or the Office of Institutional Equity and Equal Opportunity (available at [https://www.uky.edu/eeo/](https://www.uky.edu/eeo/)). Students may also contact a faculty member within the department, program director, the director of undergraduate or graduate studies, the department chair, any college administrator, or the dean. All of these individuals are mandatory reporters under University policies.
