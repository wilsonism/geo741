## I. Course Description

This seminar provides an introduction to teaching with particular focus on pedagogical issues in geography. At the completion of this course, students will have a background sufficient to enable them to assume full responsibility for university and college-level courses.

## II. Course Goals and Objectives

By placing teaching practices directly under scrutiny, this course shall:
* Trace recent socio-technical developments in the university which impact the classroom;
* Explore a variety of teaching techniques and technologies; and
* Create and refine best practices in the classroom that enroll an articulated teaching philosophy.

## III. Student Learning Outcomes

By the completion of this practicum, students shall be able to articulate their own vision for teaching while demonstrating techniques that enable that vision, while situating this philosophy in the context of changes in higher education. More specifically, students will:
* Observe a lower-division and upper-division undergraduate classroom;
* Design lesson plans, visual materials, and delivery techniques that enhance learning;
* Situate the contemporary classroom within broader debates in higher education; and
* Compose a teaching philosophy; and
* Evaluate the teaching practices of others, constructively.

## IV. Format

This course will be composed primarily of discussions and in-class activities. Students will also be required to schedule, attend, evaluate, and report on one lower-division and one upper-division undergraduate class session during the term.

## V. Required Texts

There will be required texts for some seminar discussions. Students will be responsible for gaining access to these texts from UK Libraries. Consult the course calendar below for a reading schedule (subject to change). You are attending a research 1 university, taking classes with people who do original research. As such, you may have the opportunity to read journal articles and book chapters published by your professors. Professors are not paid royalties for these publications, but they are how information is disseminated for the academic community.

## VI. Assignments, Activities, and Grading

### Assessment overview.

Students will be assessed in this practicum, for a total of 100 points:
* Report 1 (20 points)
* Report 2 (20 points)
* Discussions and Exercises (30 points)
* Teaching Philosophy (30 points)

Final grades will be based on a standard scale, i.e., A=90-100%; B=80-89%; C=70-79%; D=60-69%; E=less than 60%. Grades for all assignments will be available via the University of Kentucky Canvas system (http://uk.instructure.com).

### Reports.

Two reports will be required: one based on evaluation of a lower-division undergraduate course and one based on evaluation of an upper-division undergraduate course. Courses must be in Geography. Students are required to schedule the observation with the primary instructor (cannot be a graduate student instructor). Reports must be no more than 2-pages double-spaced, addressing (1) techniques and technologies, (2) style and performance, (3) engagement and learning.

### Discussions and exercises.

Each scheduled meeting will be composed of discussions and exercises. The exact format will vary from week to week. Students are required to attend, to gain credit for these activities.

### Teaching philosophy.

A teaching philosophy is a document that outlines a vision of teaching and learning. After reviewing and evaluating examples of teaching philosophies, students will iteratively produce their own teaching philosophy. The teaching philosophy must be no more than 4-pages double-spaced.

## VII. Important Notices

### Prepare for this course.

Review the course syllabus carefully, paying special attention to due dates and assignment instructions. If you have questions about course expectations as overviewed by this syllabus, please contact me as soon as possible.

### Attend class.

There are many in-class activities that will require your attendance. Note: Students need to notify the professor of absences prior to class in writing (or within one week after the absence). S.R. 5.2.4.2 defines the following as acceptable reasons for excused absences: (a) serious illness, (b) illness or death of family member, (c) University-related trips, (d) major religious holidays, and (e) other circumstances found to fit “reasonable cause for nonattendance” by the professor.

Students anticipating an absence for a major religious holiday are responsible for notifying the instructor in writing of anticipated absences due to their observance of such holidays no later than the last day in the semester to add a class. Information regarding dates of major religious holidays may be obtained through the religious liaison, Mr. Jake Karnes (859-257-2754). Students are expected to withdraw from the class if more than 20% of the classes scheduled for the semester are missed (excused or unexcused) per university policy.

Students may be asked to verify their absences in order for them to be considered excused. Senate Rule 5.2.4.2 states that faculty have the right to request “appropriate verification” when students claim an excused absence because of illness or death in the family. Appropriate notification of absences due to university-related trips is required prior to the absence.

### Be in contact.

You are responsible for checking your UKY email account; the class listserv is what I will use to send communications outside class. Email is the best way to contact me (place ‘GEO741’ in the subject heading). Please allow at least 24 hours for a response by email during weekdays. I will not necessarily respond to emails over the weekends.

### Be a resource for others.

I strongly encourage you to exchange contact information with classmates, in order to retrieve notes and information that you may have missed.

### Ask before recording.

Video and audio recordings are not permitted during our class meetings unless the student has received prior permission from the instructors. If permission is granted, recording of other students is prohibited. Any distribution of recordings is also probhibited. Students with specific recording accommodations approved by the Disability Resource Center should present their official documentation to the instructor. All content for this course, including handouts, assignments, and lectures are the intellectual property of the instructors and cannot be reproduced, sold, or used for any purpose other than educational work in this class without prior permission from the instructor.

### Get help.

If you are having difficulty with any course material, please contact the instructor. There are also other resources which you should find useful:
* [Pauer Center for Cartography & GIS](https://geography.as.uky.edu/cartlab) in Miller Hall 5
* [The University Writing Center](https://uky.mywconline.com)
* [Map Collections](http://libguides.uky.edu/maps), Science Library in King Library 410C
* [Stress Management Workshops](http://www.uky.edu/counselingcenter/student-services) in Frazee Hall

### Meet deadlines.

Meeting deadlines is an important professional practice. Consult the course schedule, below, for the due dates of the course assignments. A 10-percent deduction will be applied to the final score of your assignment for submissions after the deadline on the same calendar day, with an additional 10-percent deduction for each additional calendar day the assignment is late. If the assignment is not delivered by the next class meeting, the assignment will not be accepted.

### Be honest.

This course, if successful, will expose you to a variety of concepts. You are expected to draw upon these various ideas, but you must be transparent and honest about your use of these ideas. Please get help if you’re uncertain about this expectation! Per university policy, students shall not plagiarize, cheat, or falsify or misuse academic records. Students are expected to adhere to University policy on cheating and plagiarism in all courses. The minimum penalty for a first offense is a zero on the assignment on which the offense occurred. If the offense is considered severe or the student has other academic offenses on their record, more serious penalties, up to suspension from the university may be imposed.

Plagiarism and cheating are serious breaches of academic conduct. Each student is advised to become familiar with the various forms of academic dishonesty as explained in the **Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities**. Complete information can be found at the following website: http://www.uky.edu/Ombud. A plea of ignorance is not acceptable as a defense against the charge of academic dishonesty. It is important that you review this information as all ideas borrowed from others need to be properly credited.

Part II of **Student Rights and Responsibilities** (available at http://www.uky.edu/StudentAffairs/Code/part2.html) states that all academic work, written or otherwise, submitted by students to their instructors or other academic supervisors, is expected to be the result of their own thought, research, or self-expression. In cases where students feel unsure about the question of plagiarism involving their own work, they are obliged to consult their instructors on the matter before submission.

When students submit work purporting to be their own, but which in any way borrows ideas, organization, wording or anything else from another source without appropriate acknowledgement of the fact, the students are guilty of plagiarism. Plagiarism includes reproducing someone else’s work, whether it be a published article, chapter of a book, a paper from a friend or some file, or something similar to this. Plagiarism also includes the practice of employing or allowing another person to alter or revise the work which a student submits as his/her own, whoever that other person may be.

Students may discuss assignments among themselves or with an instructor or tutor, but when the actual work is done, it must be done by the student, and the student alone. When a student’s assignment involves research in outside sources of information, the student must carefully acknowledge exactly what, where and how he/she employed them. If the words of someone else are used, the student must put quotation marks around the passage in question and add an appropriate indication of its origin. Making simple changes while leaving the organization, content and phraseology intact is plagiaristic. However, nothing in these *Rules* shall apply to those ideas which are so generally and freely circulated as to be a part of the public domain (Section 6.3.1).

**Please note:** Any assignment you turn in may be submitted to an electronic database to check for plagiarism.

### Be respectful.

Students should at all times be respectful of fellow students, the professor or teaching assistant(s), and the University of Kentucky. Some basic reminders:
* Silence all mobile devices.
* Show up on time. Late arrivals (and unnecessary) early departures are rude and disruptive.
* Put away your reading material (other than materials necessary for the lecture/course).
* Talking and whispering during class is disrespectful to the professor and fellow students and makes it more difficult for those who want to learn to do so.
* Be attentive to and respectful of other students’ contributions to class discussions. Discussion must not include attacks of a personal nature, including denigrating another on the basis of skin color, sex, religion, sexual orientation, age, national/regional origin or other such irrelevant factors.

### For students with special needs:

If you have a documented disability that requires academic accommodations, please see me as soon as possible during scheduled office hours. In order to receive accommodations in this course, you must provide me with a Letter of Accommodation from the Disability Resource Center (725 Rose Street, Suite 407 Multidisciplinary Science Building, 8AM to 4:30PM, 859-257-2754, email address: jkarnes@email.uky.edu) for coordination of campus disability services available to students with disabilities.
